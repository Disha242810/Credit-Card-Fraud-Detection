Credit Card Fraud Detection using Isolation Forest
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using an unsupervised machine learning approach â€” the Isolation Forest algorithm. It is designed to identify anomalies in transactional data without requiring labeled examples of fraud.

Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a significant challenge for financial institutions, causing billions in losses each year. Detecting fraudulent transactions is difficult due to:
1) The rarity of fraud compared to legitimate transactions
2) Constantly evolving fraud patterns
3) The need for real-time and high-accuracy detection
This project explores a machine learning-based solution to detect fraud efficiently and with minimal false positives.
